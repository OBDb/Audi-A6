## Generations

The Audi A6 has gone through five main generations since its introduction in 1994:

- **C4 (1994-1997)**: The first generation A6 was essentially a renamed and facelifted Audi 100. It featured a range of inline-four and V6 engines, with both front-wheel drive and quattro all-wheel drive options. The C4 established the Audi A6 as the brand's mid-size luxury sedan and wagon (Avant).

- **C5 (1997-2004)**: The second generation brought a completely new design with a more rounded, aerodynamic appearance. It introduced the aluminum-intensive Audi Space Frame technology on the high-performance S6 and RS6 models. The C5 generation significantly improved interior quality and driving dynamics while offering a variety of engines including the 2.7T biturbo V6.

- **C6 (2004-2011)**: The third generation featured Audi's then-new single-frame grille design language and more advanced technology. It offered enhanced ride comfort, handling precision, and interior space. Notable innovations included adaptive air suspension and the MMI (Multi Media Interface) infotainment system. The C6 generation also introduced the high-performance RS6 with a twin-turbocharged V10 engine.

- **C7 (2011-2018)**: The fourth generation A6 featured a lighter construction with more aluminum components, improved efficiency, and more sophisticated technology. It introduced features like the Audi pre sense safety system and full LED headlights. The C7 generation emphasized the balance between comfort, performance, and efficiency with new hybrid options joining the lineup.

- **C8 (2018-present)**: The current fifth generation A6 represents a technological leap with a dual-touchscreen MMI system, Audi Virtual Cockpit, and mild-hybrid technology across most of the engine range. The C8 features a more aggressive exterior design while maintaining the executive sedan proportions. Advanced driver assistance systems and connectivity features place it firmly in the modern luxury segment.
